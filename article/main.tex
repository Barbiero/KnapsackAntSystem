\begin{abstract}
	This report describes the process of parallelizing the Ant Colonization Optimization algorithm, used to solve the Multiple-Constraint Knapsack problem, through a distributed memory model. It was noted that, given a sufficiently small message size that the overhead from this model is negligible, achieving very high speedup factors. It was also noted that at certain instances, there was a super-linear speedup and it was hipotesized that this happens due to the hyper-threading technology provided on the Intel i7 processor, but no conclusion was reached from this phenomenom.
